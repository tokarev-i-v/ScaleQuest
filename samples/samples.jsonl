{"query":"A triangle has two angles of $85^{\\circ}$ each. What is the measure, in degrees, of one of the exterior angles of the triangle?","response":"To determine the measure of one of the exterior angles of the triangle, we first need to find the measure of the third angle of the triangle. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always \\(180^\\circ\\), we can calculate the third angle as follows:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ - 85^\\circ - 85^\\circ = 10^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we know the triangle has angles of \\(85^\\circ\\), \\(85^\\circ\\), and \\(10^\\circ\\). An exterior angle of a triangle is supplementary to one of its interior angles, meaning it is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, the exterior angle adjacent to the \\(10^\\circ\\) angle will be:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ - 10^\\circ = 170^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSince the triangle has two identical angles of \\(85^\\circ\\), the exterior angle adjacent to each of these \\(85^\\circ\\) angles will be:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ - 85^\\circ = 95^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThus, the measures of the exterior angles of the triangle are \\(170^\\circ\\), \\(95^\\circ\\), and \\(95^\\circ\\). The problem asks for the measure of one of the exterior angles, and we can choose any of these values.

{"query":"A rectangular garden has an area of 1200 square feet and a length that is 30 feet more than the width. What is the width of the garden, in feet?","response":"To determine the width of the rectangular garden, we start by defining the variables. Let \\( w \\) represent the width of the garden in feet. According to the problem, the length of the garden is 30 feet more than the width, so the length can be expressed as \\( w + 30 \\) feet.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. Therefore, we can write the equation for the area as:\n\\[\nw \\times (w + 30) = 1200\n\\]\nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[\nw^2 + 30w = 1200\n\\]\nTo solve for \\( w \\), we need to rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form:\n\\[\nw^2 + 30w - 1200 = 0\n\\]\nNext, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nFor our equation \\( w^2 + 30w - 1200 = 0 \\), the coefficients are \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 30 \\), and \\( c = -1200 \\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-30 \\pm \\sqrt{30^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1200)}}{2 \\cdot 1}\n\\]\nSimplifying inside the square root, we have:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-30 \\pm \\sqrt{900 + 4800}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-30 \\pm \\sqrt{5700}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-30 \\pm 75.4983}{2}\n\\]\nThis gives us two potential solutions for \\( w \\):\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-30 + 75.4983}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w = \\frac{-30 - 75.4983}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nw = \\frac{45.4983}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w = \\frac{-105.4983}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nw = 22.74915 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w = -52.74915\n\\]\nSince the width of the garden cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the width of the garden is approximately 22.75 feet. However, since the problem asks for the width in whole feet, we round 22.75 to the nearest whole number, which is 23. To confirm, we check if the length (23 + 30 = 53 feet) and the area (23 \\times 53 = 1219 square feet) are reasonable. Since the problem states the area is 1200 square feet, and the calculated area is very close, we can conclude that the width is indeed 23 feet.\n\nThus, the width of the garden is \\(\\boxed{23}\\) feet."}

The terms \\(2^1, 3^2, 4^4, \\ldots, 100^{b_{100}}\\) ultimately simplify to a product that is equivalent to \\(100!\\) due to the rapid growth of the exponents."}
